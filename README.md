The model is trained on 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naseralqaydeh/named-entity-recognition-ner-corpus">this corpus</a>

The model is based on "roberta-base" from the <a href="https://huggingface.co/roberta-base">Hugging Face ðŸ¤—</a>
The Language modeling head was replaced with simple linear layer for predicting NER tags.
Additionally, the NER head takes POS tags embeddings and percentage of uppercase characters as the input.
